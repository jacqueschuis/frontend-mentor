## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was an exercise to test my CSS skills. The only assets provided by Frontend Mentor were the user profile picture and the three images used in the UI design on the screen. Every other element is created entirely with custom CSS.

I had to be sure to make my code very clear and clean to read, and with so many different rules in my CSS (32 different classes), I had to be very deliberate with my naming conventions so as not to cause confusion. 

### Moving forward

Overall, this boosted my confidence in my CSS abilities significantly, and it was a quick project to build, with less than 10hours or so spent total.

I have previously relied very heavily on frameworks (mainly Bootstrap, but also Tailwind CSS) to style my applications, but this proved to me that I don't need to rely on them so heavily. I'm able to get very clean, well-designed UIs completely from scratch.

This project also solidified my confidence in translating design files into functional applications, which will be a highly necessary skill for when I start working as a developer. My background is strong in graphic design, and I am confident in my skills to design functional and beautiful UIs on my own, but the fact of the matter is that most developers will be working with designers and acting more as a translator of a static design than a designer in their own right.
